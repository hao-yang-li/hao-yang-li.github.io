## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), pursuing a major in **Sociology** and a minor in **Computer Science**. My studies have provided rigorous training in sociological theory and research methods, complemented by extensive coursework in computer science with a focus on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

Driven by a strong conviction in the transformative potential of **interdisciplinary research**, I am passionate about exploring the convergence of social science and AI in the era of big data and intelligent technologies. I am particularly interested in how these **sociological theories-guided LLM agents** can enable novel insights into **social simulations** and complex societal dynamics.

Priviously, I serve as a **Research Intern** at Tsinghua University’s <a href="https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Future Intelligence Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://fenglixu.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Fengli Xu</a>, where I focus on **LLM-driven agents**. I am also currently supervised by <a href="https://hongru94.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Hongru Du</a> at <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/sie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia</a> and collaborating with him to focus on the research of **theory-guided LLM agent-based modeling** and exploring its applications in domains including population mobility and public health. Moreover, I am also actively working as a **Research Assistant** to explore LLM Agents that **simulate urban policy planner and human decision-making behavior** under the supervision of <a href="https://sai.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Zhanzhan Zhao</a>, Joint Assistant Professor, <a href="https://sai.cuhk.edu.cn/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of School of Artificial Intelligence</a> & <a href="https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/en/page/1350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Division of Computational Social Science</a>, <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen</a>.

<span style="color:#E4002B; font-weight: bold;">I am actively seeking M.Phil./Ph.D. opportunities (Fall 2026 intake) to further develop my research at the intersection of computational social science and LLM Agent.</span>
