## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), pursuing a major in **Sociology** and a minor in **Computer Science**. My studies have provided rigorous training in sociological theory and research methods, complemented by extensive coursework in computer science with a focus on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

Driven by a strong conviction in the transformative potential of **interdisciplinary research**, I am passionate about exploring the convergence of social science and AI in the era of big data and intelligent technologies. Currently, I serve as a **Research Intern** at Tsinghua Universityâ€™s <a href="https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Future Intelligence Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://fenglixu.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Fengli Xu</a>, where I focus on **Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents**. I am particularly interested in how these agents can enable novel insights into **social simulations** and complex societal dynamics.

For more details, please see my <a href="assets/LI_Haoyang_CV_20250624.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CV</a>.

<span style="color:#E4002B; font-weight: bold;">I am actively seeking M.Phil./Ph.D. opportunities (Fall 2026 intake) to further develop my research at the intersection of computational social science and LLM Agent.</span>

## Research Interests

- **Computational Social Science & LLM Agent**: Sociological theory + LLM agents, LLM-based multi-agent systems, LLM for social simulation
- **Quantitative Sociology**: Social statistics, Hypothesis testing, Regression models
- **Social Stratification**: Social capital, Cultural reproduction
- **Social Networks**: Structure of social networks (structure hole, tie strength, etc.)
