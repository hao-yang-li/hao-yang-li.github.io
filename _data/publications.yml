   abs:  'We proposed <strong>CrimeMind</strong>, a novel LLM-driven Agent-based modeling (ABM) framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban context. By applying theories from sociology and criminology into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, the crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy achieving up to <strong>a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline</strong> of both traditional ABMs and deep learning baselines'
