   abs:  'We proposed <strong>CrimeMind</strong>, a <strong>novel LLM-driven Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) framework</strong> for urban crime simulation. Integrating criminology/sociology theories into agent design, it <strong>improves crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy by 24%<strong> versus leading traditional ABM and deep learning baselines.'
