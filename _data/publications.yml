   abs:  'We proposed <strong>CrimeMind</strong>, a <strong>novel LLM-driven Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) framework</strong> for urban crime simulation. Integrating criminology and sociology theories into agent design, it <strong>improves crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy by 24%</strong> versus traditional ABM and deep learning baselines.'

- title: 'The Emergence of Altruism in Large-Language-Model Agents Society'

  abs: 'We introduce a <strong>Schelling-variant urban migration model</strong> to create a large-scale social dilemma for over 200 LLM agents, investigating the emergence of altruism. Our work provides the first evidence of a fundamental behavioral divide, identifying two archetypes: <strong>"Adaptive Egoists,"</strong> who respond to social norms, and <strong>"Altruistic Optimizers,"</strong> who inherently prioritize collective good. We show social interaction can increase altruistic actions significantly in egoistic models, proposing that the choice of LLM for social simulation is a choice of theoretical foundation.'
